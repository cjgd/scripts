This is a collection of scripts, mainly in perl, sh, awk and sed.

They are organized by functionality, but one can search for some
families by its extension: 

	find . -name \*.sed

will give all sed scripts available.


On INDEX, there is a description of all stuff.
One can search there, to get hints for something, eg: I want
to find script to convert from dos to unix: 

	grep -i 'unix.*dos' INDEX
convert/dos2unix.pl     convert a CRLF line ended filename to a LF one
convert/fromdos         convert msdos EOL to unix


Also, almost every files has somewhere in the beginning, something
like:

	name -- description

and utils/get-desc.pl can be used to get a list of 'filename  description'
automatically.
