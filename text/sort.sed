# How does this work?
# 
# o first all lines are joined in this format
# 
# \na line_a \nA
# \nb line_b \nB
# \nl next_line \nL
# \nl next_line \nL
# ...
# 
# o general markers are of the form \n<letter> (and a \n can not appear alone)
# 
# o the following algorithm is used: 
# 
# 	start at 2
# 	1. a = a+1
# 	2. a at end? yes: exit, no: continue
# 	3. make b = a+1
# 	4. sort a vs b 
# 	5. b at end? yes: goto 1; no: continue
# 	6. b = b+1; goto 4
# 
# o the sorting by itself is done this way: 
# 	
# 	. after isolating the line a and b, add a table, with order we want
# 	. then match the initial common part of both lines, for instance
# 		line_a: xxxx1
# 		line_b: xxx22
# 	  it would store xxx x1 22, i.e. common rest_of_a rest_of_b 
# 	. if the RE \(first_char_of_a\) \(first_char_of_b\) \1.*\2 exist
# 	  then the line is sorted already, do nothing
# 	. else swap them
# 
# 	(for instance, "a" is \1 "g" is \2, then \1.*\2 exist, because table
# 	is abcdefg..., but if \1 was "k", then \1.*\2 do not exit on table)
#
